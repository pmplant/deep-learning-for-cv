def normalize(data, data_mean=None, data_range=None):
    """Normalizes input data.

    Notice that we have two optional input arguments to this function. When
    dealing with validation/test data, we expect these to be given, since we
    should not learn or change *anything* of the trained model. This includes
    the data preprocessing step.

    In other words, if `data_mean` and `data_range` is provided, we will use
    them. Otherwise we will compute them in this function and use those values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Input data that we want to normalize. NxD, where D is the
        dimension of the input data.

    data_mean : ndarray (optional)
        Mean of the data that we should use. 1xD is expected. If not given,
        this will be computed from `data`.

    data_range : ndarray (optional)
        Standard deviation of the data. 1xD is expected. If not given, this
        will be computed from `data`.

    Returns
    -------
    data_n : ndarray
        Normalized data. NxD, where D is the dimension of the input data.

    data_mean : ndarray
        Mean. 1xD. This will be used to apply the same normalization to the
        test data if necessary.

    data_range : ndarray
        The divisor applied to normalizing data. This is to be used later on
        val/test data as in the case as `data_mean`

    """
